	How to Deal with Unassigned Tickets
</h1>
<p>
	Whenever you see an unassigned ticket, please refer to the General Trouble Shooting section of the <a href='index.html'>Hotline Training</a> (<strong>Note:<strong> The hostname can be found on a sticker on the computer tower or you can refer to this link: <a href='https://support.office.com/en-us/article/do-you-need-help-locating-your-computer-name-00384381-8aa9-4398-b81b-475f09fed618'>How to Find your Device Name on Windows</a> or here: <a 'https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/find-my-linux-machine-name/'>How to Find Device Name on Linux</a> for Linux OS. If the problem is occuring to multiple computers in a lab or in all the computers, make sure to get the hostname of 2 or 3 of the computers in the lab that are definitely exhibiting the issue.)

  How to Assign Tickets to the Software Team
</h1>
<p>
	We will now be assigning tickets to specific people on the software team. The team as a whole isn't responsible for all of the software, instead the softwares are split up between different people on the team and these people are each responsible for a subset of the software list. You all should have access (if you don't, please email Greg to request access) to a spreadsheet which outlines who is responsible for what software. Use this to find out who is responsible for the software in question and then assign both them and the software team to the issue.
