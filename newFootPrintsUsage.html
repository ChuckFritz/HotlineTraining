<h1>
	How to Deal with Unassigned Tickets
</h1>
<p>
	Whenever you see an unassigned ticket, please refer to the <strong>General Trouble Shooting</strong> section of the <a href='index.html'>Hotline Training</a> to ensure that sufficient information has been provided. If additional information is required, please reply to the ticket and set the status of the ticket to "Work in Progress". If the ticket is supposed to be assigned to the software team, don't assign the ticket to a specific person on the team until sufficient information has been collected. Once you have collected the information you believe to be necessary, assign the ticket to a specific person (refer to <strong>How to Assign Tickets to the Software Team</strong> for more information) and set the status to "Open".   
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> A good rule of thumb is to look up the issue in Footprints. By viewing similar issues, you can figure out what information was necessary to solve the issue and request it ahead of time.

  How to Assign Tickets to the Software Team
</h1>
<p>
	We will now be assigning tickets to specific people on the software team. The team as a whole isn't responsible for all of the software, instead the softwares are split up between different people on the team and these people are each responsible for a subset of the software list. You all should have access (if you don't, please email Greg to request access) to a spreadsheet which outlines who is responsible for what software. Use this to find out who is responsible for the software in question and then assign both them and the software team to the issue.
