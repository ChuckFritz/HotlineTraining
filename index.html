<h1>
  CAEN Hotline Summer Training
</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the CAEN Hotline! This site will serve as a introduction to and training for your duties at the CAEN Hotline.
</p>

<p>
  The CAEN Hotline currently serves as the front line of IT service at the College of Engineering. We are the first contact for people experiencing errors or having issues with CAEN services. Our job is to help these people as best we can. This can either mean handling the issue yourself or relaying the issue to one of the departments in CAEN that can better handle the issue. In this training you should learn how to both troubleshoot an issue and attempt to fix it yourself and evaluate whether an issue is outside of the scope of your responsibilities and should be relayed to a more specialized team.
</p>

<p>
   You are coming to the Hotline at a very interesting time in its life cycle. We are currently redesigning the Hotline. Its responsibilities and role at the university will be changing while you are here. This means the aforementioned "scope of your responsibilities" will be changing. While these changes are not yet well defined, you can expect that you will be responsible for many more technical issues and will become more involved with the backend for many of the services CAEN provides.
</p>

<p>
  Without further ado, let's get into it.
</p>

    <strong>Documentation</strong>
  </summary>

  <p>
    Currently CAEN provides a great deal of documentation that is intended to explain the services we provide. Since it is likely that you do not know all of this documentation, you should spend a significant amount of time in your early employment at the Hotline reading this documentation and becoming very familiar with it. Questions that can be answered within this documentation are 100% <strong>your responsibility</strong>. It will be expected that you can answer these questions without refering to the full-time staff.
  </p>

  <p>
    Does this mean we expect you to have the documentation memorized? Well kind of, eventually, but initially, no it does not.
  </p>

  <p>
  Does this mean we expect you to search the documentation for answers to questions you don't think you have the answer to? <strong>Yes, absolutely it does.</strong> Anytime you don't know the answer to a question, take a minute and search the documentation for an answer. You may feel as though you are making the customer wait, but that is okay. The amount of time it takes you to search through the documentation is much shorter than the amount of time it will take for one of the full-time teams to get to the issue and set aside time to address it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>There are three main sources of documentation:</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://caenfaq.engin.umich.edu/'>The CAEN Knowledge Base</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a public source of information that CAEN has published detailing a great deal of the services CAEN provides. This is the most valuble resource at your disposal and should be the first thing you consult when you have any questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note: Since this is a public site, you can send links to this site to customers to help explain things to the customer.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://caen.engin.umich.edu'>The CAEN Homepage</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the drop-down menus on the top the the CAEN homepage there is more information on the services we provide. Much of this is a rehashing of the information in the Knowledge Base but there are some details presented here that may not be in the Knowledge Base. This should be your second consultation when trying to solve an issue you do not currently know how to fix.
  </p>

  <p>
    Important links to note on this page:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
     Under "About" there is a link that reads "Departmental IT Support Staff," this provides a list of the departmental IT contacts for all of the major departments in the College of Engineering
    </li>
    <li>
    Under "Help & Support" on the left hand side there is a link to the CAEN "Service Status" page, this will provide you with an up-to-date list of any outages or degraded services CAEN is currently aware of
    </li>
    <li>
      Under the same section is a link to "News & Announcements," here is where you can see information about all of the major changes coming to CAEN. This will often be a great place to refer people when they are confused about or unaware of a change in CAENs operations
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <em>Note: Since this is a public site, you can send links to this site to customers to help explain things to the customer.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/Main_Page'>Hotline Wiki</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is the Hotline's internal documentation written for students, by students (mostly). This documentation is old and infrequently updated, so take caution when referencing this documentation. If you can find the information elsewhere it is recommended that you rely on that information rather than that provided in the Wiki.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Wiki is still a great resource for referencing Hotline policies and procedures. Any time you are questioning the steps to opening the Hotline, or how to work the phones (suprisingly complicated), or how to open a new CAEN account or other such issues consulting the Hotline Wiki should be the first step. If you look hard enough there is even a comprehensive guide to performing a spinning hook kick.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note: Since this is an internal site you will not be able to provide customers links to these pages.</em>

     <strong>Hotline Policies</strong>
   <summary>
   <p>
    <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/Policies_%26_Rules'>General Hotline Policies</a>
    <strong><em text-decoration="underline">It is very important that you understand and follow the policies listed in the above link!!!</em></strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Make sure you always follow opening, closing, and on-shift procedures.  

    <em>That said</em>, note the following errata, policy details that are <strong>outdated or missing from the Wiki:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>CAEN has a <a href='uofmcaen.slack.com'>Slack channel</a> that the Wiki does not mention. <strong>You are required to have this Slack channel open during your shift.</strong></li>
        <li>Notes are no longer taken at Hotline Meetings.</li>
        <li>Hotline meetings have been on hiatus in recent semesters. Please consult an FTE re: scheduling meetings, whether there are regular weekly meetings, and other special meetings. <strong>Attendance at all Hotline meetings is mandatory. You must inform an FTE if you cannot attend.</li>
        <li>The "Google Talk client" is Google Hangouts. It is not strictly required you have it open during your shift, but it is strongly recommended. It's often the best and fastest way to communicate with your FTEs (and for them to reach you and send you important info/links), and it's useful for sharing dank memes with your fellow Hotline colleagues.
    </ul>
