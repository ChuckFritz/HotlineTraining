<p>
	Welcome back to the Hotline. The first order of business...The Hotline is dead.
</p>
<p>
	Well not really dead so much as reborn from the ashes of what it used to be. We are now taking a much more active role in CAEN's backend (i.e. the stuff we used to call "above our pay grade"). What used to be the "CAEN Hotline" is now the "CAEN Help Desk" (*weeps uncontrollably*) and we are now a part of the Student Computing Environment (SCE) team. This is the team that contains the Software group the Windows Systems group and the Linux group, and we at the Help Desk will be responsible for working with the full time employees in these groups to solve the tickets that are assigned to them.
</p>
<p>
	As part of this absorbtion by the SCE team we are now under new management. Our new managers are Greg Baker (bakegreg), Katarina Lukaszewicz (katlukas) and Markus Nee (markusn) who are on the Windows Systems, Linux and Software teams respectively. You can email them with any questions, concerns or issues that come up. To reach all of them at once without using the cc function, you can send an email to caen-help-desk-supervisors@umich.edu.
</p>
<p>
	There are a few ways that the Help Desk works differently from the Hotline. First, and most importantly, we are now allowed (expected) to reply to tickets if we know the answer to the problem or if we find that the ticket contains insufficient information (ie. No host name of the computer, no lab location, etc.). We have also been added into software support, windows system support and linux support footprints group. Therefore, we are also responsible for reading through the reply to the tickets in which we are assigned.
